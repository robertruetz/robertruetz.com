				<p>
					My name is Robert, and I have a problem: too many interests, not enough time to properly pursue them all.
					Professionally, I'm an audio editor,	recording and editing audio for <a href="http://www.walshmedia.com">Walsh Media, Inc.</a>
					I've also dabbled	in video editing, although I don't claim to be an expert. However, in my spare time (and even on the clock, shhhh), 
					I love to code. My first experiences with coding on a practical level came when I was faced with repetitive audio-related tasks
					that could only logically be solved with a C# script in Sound Forge (audio editing software). From there I started playing
					around with Java, Ruby and Python, but never managed to attain a high level of proficiency. I've now shelved all
					of that for a bit while I wrap my noodle around this whole web development thing. So, herein you will find my adventures
					with web dev. I like to learn. What could possibly go wrong? Well, you'll get to find out if you follow the	evolution of this website.
